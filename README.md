# A Simple Markov Chain to Predict Next Diagnosis
The purpose of this project is to develop an understanding of the underlying Markov Chains. One can use the concepts to take on the financial problems that can be solved using applications of Markov Chain. These include Brand loyalty, Predicting Market Share, Market Trend and Credit Risk Management. I have taken on disease prediction examples of Markov chain that are really important in todays modern time. A multimorbid patient (A patient having more than one chronic diseases) get more chronic diseases quickly if he/she are not taking precaustionary measures. It often leads to poor quality of life and mortality. Such recommendation systems are important both for awareness purpose and for medical professionals to correctly assign the diagnosis based on probabilities.
